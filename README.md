# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for **predicting breast cancer**.  

- `breast_cancer.py` → Streamlit app that loads a pre-trained model to make predictions.  
- `trained_model.sav` → Pre-trained model used for predictions.  
- `ml.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code to train the machine learning model.  
- `requirements.txt` → List of required Python packages.

**Purpose:**  
The project allows users to input patient data and get a prediction of whether breast cancer is likely, based on the trained model.  

**Includes:**  
- Model training code  
- Pre-trained model for immediate use  
- Streamlit app for interactive predictions
